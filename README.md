# Password Generate Machine

## Welcome To My Project

Welcome to the Password Generate Machine project! This simple yet powerful tool allows you to create strong and secure passwords with ease. Whether you're an employee with access to sensitive data or just someone who values online security, this application has got you covered.

## User Story

As an employee with access to sensitive data, I want to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria so that I can create a strong password that provides greater security.

You can access the deployed application [here](https://nhunguyen-debug.github.io/MyChallenge3-Passwordgenerate/).

## Acceptance Criteria

To ensure the security and usability of this password generator, we have established the following acceptance criteria:

1. **Generate Password Button**: When you click the button to generate a password, the application should initiate the password creation process.

2. **Password Criteria Prompts**: After clicking the button, you will be presented with a series of prompts to specify the password criteria.

3. **Password Length**: You can choose a password length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters.

4. **Character Types**: You can select which character types to include in the password, including lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters.

5. **Input Validation**: Your input will be validated, ensuring that at least one character type is selected and the length falls within the specified range.

6. **Password Generation**: Once all prompts are answered and the criteria are validated, a password will be generated that matches your selected criteria.

7. **Display Generated Password**: The generated password will either be displayed in an alert or written to the page, making it easy for you to copy and use.
